<body>: The main content of the web page is contained within this section.

<div class="container">: A container div that holds the content of the page.

<div class="item g1">: A div with the class "item" and "g1". It appears to represent a section of the page, possibly for navigation.

<div class="nav">: A div with the class "nav", which likely represents the navigation bar.

Several <div> elements containing <button> and <img> elements. These represent navigation buttons and an image.
<div class="item g2">: Another div with the class "item" and "g2". This might represent another section of the page.

An <img> element that displays an image using a base64-encoded data URL.
The code creates a navigation bar (<div class="nav">) with buttons for "Home," "About," "Menu," and "Contact," along with an image.

The last <div class="item g2"> contains an <img> element that displays an image using a base64-encoded data URL. This image is embedded directly in the HTML.

Overall, this HTML code forms the structure of a web page with a navigation bar and an image.
